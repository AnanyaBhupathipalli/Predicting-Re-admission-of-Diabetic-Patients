## Predicting Hospital Re-admission of Diabetic Patients

Data Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008

The objective of this project was to identify factors which help predict whether a diabetic patient will be re-admitted to the hospital. Itâ€™s not necessary that each medication impacts all individuals in the same way and predicting the chances of readmission provides insights  on whether the dose of medication for that individual was appropriate or not. The prediction of recurrence of diabetes can help the patients to take active measures in order to control their diabetic conditions.

We used Python and big data technology Spark (PySpark library in Python) for coding.

First step in building this model was to perform exploratory data analysis, find insights and identify factors from the data that would act as best predictors.
